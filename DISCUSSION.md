# Post-completion

This was a nice assessment to work on!

If I were to continue working on this, there are a few things I would improve on:

- Debounce the search to avoid hammering the server with requests
- Modify the table rows to be less "spreadsheet"-like. We can get rid of the header, and make each row like a card that shows just 2 or 3 columns (e.g. first column has the full name, city, degree, years of experience, phone number, and the second column would have the specialties)
- Instead of just having a single search input, also include filters (e.g. "Degree", "Specialties", etc.) to improve the UX and further drive the search query.
- Format certain details (e.g. phone number as "(555) 123-4567", etc.)
